## Problem 1:

## Problem 2:

I compared my visualization with Mrinal Soni's visualization for problem 2. 

Mrinal's visualization can be found here: https://github.com/mrinaaall/DS-5500/blob/master/InfoVizHW1.pdf.

My visualization can be found here: https://github.com/noahdemoes/DS5500_Homework1/blob/master/DS5500_Homework1.pdf.

### Similarities and Differences
Mrinal's visualization differs than mine in several ways. Mrinal used only one plot to answer the question. I needed 6 plots, one to show the change in GDP/capita for each region over time and 5 additional plots to capture GDP/captia as a function of time for all countries in each region. Mrinal reduced the continents into 4 regions while I kept the continents seperate. Mrinal also restricts the time period o 1960-2015 while I include results from 1800 to 2050.

We are similar in that we use the same visualization technique. We both had 3 variables of interest, GDP/Capita, time, and country/continent and utilized a two dimenisional, static plot to visualize our results. To capture the 3rd variable, region/country, we colored the line plot of the corresponding country.

#### Interpretable

Mrinal's visualization is easy to interpret the change in average country GDP over time for each world region. It is clear that the x-axis is the time variable, the y-axis is the Average Country GDP, and each of the color's represents a one of four different world regions. Although, easy to interpret it may be benefical to include the units for GDP. For example is the units on the y-axis representing dollars, thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, etc. 

### Effective

Mrinal's visualization does not effectively capture the entire intent of what is being asked because there is no way to determine for a specific country how that country's GDP/Capita changed over time. Mrinal's visualization is effective in capturing the Average Country GDP for each world region.


## Problem 3
I am comparing my results for problem 3 with Monica Mirsha's, which can be found here:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8EY74vQxPubjXHywpDUYo7a3FMj-GuB.

Mine are still found here: https://github.com/noahdemoes/DS5500_Homework1/blob/master/DS5500_Homework1.pdf.

### Similarities and Differences

Monica uses the same approach that I do and splits this problem into three plots, one for each of the variables in question, Life exceptancy, Child mortality, and GDP/Captia. Monica does better than me by including what the units are for the variable on the Y-axis. Monica worked un the google colab which includes more interactive features that my static plots do not provide.

### Interpretable

Monica's visualizations are highly interpretable. Each continent is clearly defined by a unique color. All titles and axis labels are included and are descriptive. 

### Effective

Monica's visualizations are highly effective in answering the questions because they include all necessary and relavant information that enables a view to quickly digest and understand the information presented.
